## iris-classifier 
    Kuddos people,
          I have wriiten classifier from scatch, using the scrppy version of K-Nearest Neighbours:
          Here are the functions and libraries used in this program for different uses:
          scipy   ::    for computational mathematics
          sklearn ::    for playing with dataset
          
          The classifier has three functions:
          fit     ::    for assigning the training data set
          predict ::    for prediction of results
          closest ::    for computing closest distance between two points
          
          The output of the classifier is:
          THe accuracy of the classifier on the traning data.
